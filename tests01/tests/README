	HOW TO TEST LEXER
=======================================

1. In the main directory:
	gcc scanner.c scanner-unit.c -o scanner -std=c99
2. ./scanner ./tests/xxx.java
3. Compare the output with xxx.java.result

=======================================
	HOW TO COMPARE TWO PROGRAMS
=======================================

1. Enter ./tests/ (current dir)
2. chmod +x compare.sh
3. ./compare.sh FIRST_FILE SECOND_FILE
	will automatically run lexical analysis of both programs
	and compare the results
	=> useful for finding small bugs and misinterpretations
